# basic-shell

Hello, world!

i have developed a mini shell script based on python
it'd be really helpful to point out any issues on this
project at my [Github](https://github.com/potato-pack/basic-shell/)

here's the [wiki](https://github.com/potato-pack/basic-shell/wiki)

## Remember
  * it is only basic
  so don't expect parallel processing
  or compiling or anything like that.


  * this is not intended for industrial use.


  * and this is currently in beta stages (still in development)
  so it may still produce error messages!


## Documentation
  First, install it.
  `pip install basic-shell`
  ```
  import basicshell
  ```
